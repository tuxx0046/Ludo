# Ludo game in C# - WPF

This is a project with the goal of creating a functioning Ludo game.
Purpose of the project is to learn and understand object oriented programming and put it to practice.

The Ludo game I've made is very bare bones and probably with some bugs. 
Not all of the Ludo rules have been implemented, like Stars and Globus, so it's very simple.
