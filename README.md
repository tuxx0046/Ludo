# Ludo game in C# - WPF

This is a school project with the goal of creating a functioning Ludo game.
Purpose of the project is to understand object oriented programming and put it to practice.

The Ludo game I've made is very barebones. Not all of the Ludo rules have been implemented, like Stars and Globus, so it's very simple.
